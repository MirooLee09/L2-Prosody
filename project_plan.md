## Project plan

**Goal**  
--------
This project aims to investigate which listening tasks reveal a temporary shift in speech perception between two different language contexts by bilingual and monolingual listeners. It specifically focuses on relating the observed temporary perceptual adaptations to individual listeners' language history and sound category development. The main questions are:  

_Q1. What are the cue-weighting patterns of English monolinguals in English sessions and Korean-English bilinguals in Korean sessions?_ 

_Q2. How do bilingualsâ€™ category knowledge and cross category linkage develop over time?_

_Q3. How does language mode develop as listeners transition from being monolingual to bilingual?_  

To answer these questions, I am conducting a series of listening tasks online. There are three main stages to this project. The first is to preparing the experiment. In this stage, I create stimuli using Praat. The second stage is data collection. The third stage is data analysis.  

**Preparing the experiment**  
--------------
For this study, I aim to run three types of listening tasks; labeling, goodness-judgement, and AX-discrimination task. In order to create acoustic stimuli that will be used for the three listening tasks, I am using a base sound (CV9_VOT40_F230_edit_int.wav). With this base token, I will create three F0 continua, each with VOT of value of 5, 25, and 45ms.  

**The base sound**  
The base sound [CV9_VOT40_F230.wav](CV9_VOT40_F230.wav)[^1] was created by splicing lip apperture and vowel portion from [bot.wav](bot.wav)[^2] to VOT portion from [pot.wav](pot.wav)[^3] with two additional intensity modifications.  

_[^1] CV9_VOT40_F230.wav is CV99_VOT40_F230_edit_int.wav from Comps1 project_  
_[^2]bot.wav is bot1.wav from Comps1 project_  
_[^3]pot.wav is pot1.wav from Comps1 project_
