**Goal**  
--------
This project aims to investigate which listening tasks reveal a temporary shift in speech perception between two different language contexts by bilingual and monolingual listeners. It specifically focuses on relating the observed temporary perceptual adaptations to individual listeners' language history and sound category development. The main questions are:  
_Q1. What are the cue-weighting patterns of English monolinguals in English sessions and Korean-English bilinguals in Korean sessions?_ 

_Q2. How do bilingualsâ€™ category knowledge and cross category linkage develop over time?_

_Q3. How does language mode develop as listeners transition from being monolingual to bilingual?_
